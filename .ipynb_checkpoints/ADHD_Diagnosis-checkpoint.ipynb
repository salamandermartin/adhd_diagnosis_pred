    "ADHD, also known as Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (formerly also ADD) is a mental disorder that often goes undiagnosed in those it afflicts. It is also often mischaracterized as a disorder that 'just' makes kids rowdy. But it should be known that many adults are undiagnosed and it can greatly affect quality of life in all people.\n",
